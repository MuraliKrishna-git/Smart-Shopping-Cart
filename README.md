# 🛒 Smart Shopping Cart  

The **Smart Shopping Cart** is an innovative project designed to revolutionize the shopping experience by automating product selection using embedded systems and robotics. This repository contains everything you need to build, program, and operate the Smart Shopping Cart.  

---

## 🌟 Overview  

The Smart Shopping Cart comprises **three main components**:  

### 1️⃣ **User Interface Module**  
- **📦 Components**: OLED Display, Arduino UNO R3, Push Buttons.  
- **⚙️ Functionality**:  
  - Displays the shopping mart's product list on the OLED display.  
  - Navigate through the product list using buttons (⬆️⬇️✔️).  
  - Finalize the shopping list and send it to the Line-Follower module.  

### 2️⃣ **Line-Follower with RFID Reader Module**  
- **📦 Components**: IR Sensors, RFID Reader, Arduino UNO R3, L298N Motor Driver, BO Motors.  
- **⚙️ Functionality**:  
  - Guides the cart along a pre-defined path using IR sensors.  
  - Reads RFID tags near products and matches them with the shopping list.  
  - Signals the Robotic Arm module to pick up the identified product.  

### 3️⃣ **Robotic Arm Module** (🔧 *Under Development*)  
- **📦 Components**: Servo Motors, Arduino UNO R3.  
- **⚙️ Functionality**:  
  - Picks up and places products into the cart when signaled by the Line-Follower module.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

1. **🔧 Prepare the Hardware**:  
   - Assemble the User Interface, Line-Follower module, and Robotic Arm module.  
   - Connect the components as specified in the code.  

2. **💻 Upload the Code**:  
   - Upload the `.ino` files to the respective Arduino boards:  
     - User Interface: `adafruit_ssd1306_cart.ino`  
     - Line-Follower: `Interface-Line-RFID_Code.ino`  
     - RFID Setup: `RFID-read_and_save.ino`  
     - Robotic Arm: `Robo_Arm_Test.ino`  

3. **▶️ Start the System**:  
   - Power on the system.  
   - Use the User Interface to create a shopping list.  
   - Let the cart navigate and pick up products automatically!
